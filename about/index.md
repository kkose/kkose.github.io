I am a post-doctoral researcher @ Dermatology Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. An engineer, aiming to develop new computerized methods for processing confocal microscopy images of skin. Machine learning methods for analyzing images, creating new image representations, and enhancing imaging quality are some of the applications that I am doing research on. 

## My research interests include:

* Developing machine learning methods for automated analysis
* Creating new image representations for diagnosis
* Enhancing the imaging quality through denoising and artifact cleaning
